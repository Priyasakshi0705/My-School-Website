He settled down at Capernaum, earned his living by fishing until Jesus called him to “become a fisher of men”. His name was Simon, but our Lord, on first meeting him that he should be Kephas, the Aramaic equivalent of the Greek Word whose English Form is Peter (i.e. rock). He is Premier among the twelve disciples, a man of great holiness and meekness. It was he who, as the spokesman of the rest made sublime profession of faith, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the Living God”. God filled him with true wisdom and knowledge. He preached the first public sermon at Pentecost. There are two books in the Holy Bible to his credit. He urges his readers to live as people belong to God. He says that “God doesn’t want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn from their sins”. The passion of St.Peter took place in Rome during the reign of Nero. When he came to the cross he said, “I am not worthy to be put on cross like as my Lord was, therefore turn my cross and crucify me my head downward”. St.Peter is a true model for all students seeking moral and intellectual attainments. May all the Peterians be rock-like as St.Peter was, in their convictions based on noble virtues, refined character and faith in Divine Power.</h4>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12"><b>1. Accuracy</b>
                    Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.
                    <br>
                    <b>2. Economics</b>
                    Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing automated attendance management systems.
                    <br>
                   <b> 3. Productivity / Efficiency</b>
                    Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits.
